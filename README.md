# Medium

The goal of this repository is to give a convenient and easy way to learn and experiment with example code I have written about on Medium.

### Getting Started

You will first need to run

`npm install`

After that completes you will want to view the `scripts` object in `package.json` for the most update commands.

For example if you wanted to run the code associated to the tutorial on TypeScript interfaces you would want to run `npm run ts:interfaces`
